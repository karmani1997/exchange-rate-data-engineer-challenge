# Data Pipeline for Exchange Rate Processing

This repository contains the code for a data pipeline designed to process exchange rate data. The pipeline comprises several stages, including data extraction, transformation, validation, and loading into a BigQuery table. Additionally, a schema for the BigQuery table is provided to maintain data integrity and optimize querying.

## Task 1
Please refer [Task 1 README](https://github.com/karmani1997/exchange-rate-data-engineer-challenge/tree/main/etl) for details as to how to run the pipeline locally.

## Task 2
Please refer [Task 2 README](https://github.com/karmani1997/exchange-rate-data-engineer-challenge/tree/main/task-2) for details Data Architecture and Pipeline Design.

## Improvements
- **Error handling**: Implement mechanisms to handle potential errors during each stage (e.g., API failures, transformation errors, loading issues).
